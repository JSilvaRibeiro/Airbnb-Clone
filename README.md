# Airbnb Clone

This is an Airbnb clone web application built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js).

## How to Run

To run the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine: git clone https://github.com/JSilvaRibeiro/Airbnb-Clone.git
2. Navigate to the project directory: cd airbnb-clone
3. Install dependencies for both the frontend and backend: npm run install-deps
4. Start both the frontend and backend servers concurrently: npm run start-app


This will start the frontend server (React) and the backend server (Node.js) concurrently, allowing you to access the application locally in your web browser.

Once the servers are running, you can access the frontend at [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) and the backend API at [http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000).
